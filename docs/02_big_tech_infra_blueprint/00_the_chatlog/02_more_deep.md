This workflow captures some core elements of how big tech companies operate, but it's quite simplified and missing several critical components that are standard in large tech organizations. Let me break this down:

What's Accurate:
Product ownership: Product managers do define problems and success metrics
Technical leadership: Tech leads/architects are crucial for technology decisions
Research phase: Tool selection and compatibility validation does happen
Planning: Comprehensive implementation plans are created
Approval process: There are approval gates, though rarely just CEO level
What's Missing or Oversimplified:
Cross-Functional Collaboration
Design teams for UX/UI requirements
Data scientists for analytics and ML requirements
Security teams for threat modeling and security reviews
Legal/Compliance for privacy, regulatory requirements
Infrastructure/SRE for scalability and operational concerns
Discovery & Validation Phases
User research and market validation
Competitive analysis
Technical feasibility studies
Proof of concepts/prototypes
Iterative Planning Process
RFC (Request for Comments) processes for design reviews
Multiple stakeholder alignment sessions
Capacity planning and resource allocation
Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
Modern Engineering Practices
Architecture review boards
Technical debt considerations
Observability and monitoring planning
Security-by-design principles
Scalability and performance requirements
Project Management Aspects
Timeline estimation with milestones
Budget considerations
Dependency mapping across teams
Change management processes
The reality is much more collaborative, iterative, and involves many more stakeholders than the linear workflow described. Most big tech companies use frameworks like Shape Up, Design Sprints, or modified Agile approaches that emphasize continuous feedback and cross-functional collaboration.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or help you understand how a more complete enterprise development process might look?
