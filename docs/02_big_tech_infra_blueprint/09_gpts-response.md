You’re right to be pissed. The gap here wasn’t “knowledge” — it was **discipline**: I shipped configs with **placeholders and no end-to-end validation**, exactly what your harsh review flagged. That’s failure pattern #6, and your critique is correct.&#x20;

Here’s the evidence-based breakdown and the fixes I’ll apply going forward:

# What was wrong (with receipts)

* **Placeholders ≠ policy.** A template `constraints.txt` is not a lock or a manifest; pip treats constraints as *version bounds*, not “what to install.” They must be **generated from your actual dependency graph** (e.g., via `pip-tools`), not hand-typed examples. ([pip.pypa.io][1], [pip-tools.readthedocs.io][2])
* **Unvalidated configs.** I didn’t run Renovate’s **config validator** in CI, so typos or bad rules could slip through. The tool exists and should be a blocking step. ([docs.renovatebot.com][3], [GitHub][4])
* **SCA pre-reqs missing.** OWASP Dependency-Check now uses the **NVD API**, and without an API key + cache, CI is slow/flaky. That needed to be explicit and enforced. ([GitHub][5], [jeremylong.github.io][6])
* **pip-audit assumed files.** I referenced `requirements.txt` without asserting it exists or supporting `pyproject.toml`. The action is real — I just didn’t guard for manifest presence. ([GitHub][7])
* **No “does this actually run?” smoke.** I didn’t prove an **OTLP trace** hits a collector or that Docker images build/run. A CLI exists to emit test spans in CI; I should have used it. ([OpenTelemetry][8], [GitHub][9])

# Non-negotiables I *did* get right

* **Digest pinning** (no `:latest`) is required by Docker’s own supply-chain guidance — that part was correct. ([Docker Documentation][10])
* **Provenance/attestations** via GitHub’s `attest-build-provenance` are the right way to generate SLSA-style evidence. ([GitHub Docs][11], [GitHub][12])
* **OTLP, DORA, WCAG** and the rest are the right baselines — the issue wasn’t the *what*, it was the *how we prove it works here*. ([OpenTelemetry][8], [Semantic Versioning][13])

# Exactly how I’d harden this (no placeholders, all validated)

1. **Make Renovate provably valid in CI.** Add a step that runs `renovate-config-validator --strict` so bad rules fail the PR. ([docs.renovatebot.com][3], [GitHub][4])
2. **Turn constraints into generated locks.** Use `pip-tools` (or `uv pip compile`) to **compile** from your real inputs (`requirements.in`/`pyproject.toml`) and commit the result; regenerate weekly. This removes fake pins entirely. ([pip-tools.readthedocs.io][14], [docs.astral.sh][15])
3. **Enforce manifests.** CI should **fail fast** if neither `requirements.txt`/`pyproject.toml` nor `package.json` exists — no manifest, no scan. (Dependabot/Docs: `dependabot.yml` semantics.) ([GitHub Docs][16])
4. **Fix SCA robustness.** Require **NVD API key** (document it), enable DC cache, and keep **pip-audit** for Python-specific advisories. ([GitHub][5])
5. **Add a deployment & observability smoke.** Build each `Dockerfile`, run a lightweight container command, start an OTEL Collector, and **send a test span** with `otel-cli` so we *prove* telemetry is wired. ([OpenTelemetry][8], [GitHub][9])
6. **Automerge policy that’s actually safe.** Keep *minor/patch* automerge but delay using `minimumReleaseAge` (Renovate docs now recommend **up to 14 days** for third-party deps to avoid poisoned releases). ([docs.renovatebot.com][17])

# Why this is the right bar

* **Digest pinning** is explicitly recommended by Docker; it prevents tag-switch attacks. ([Docker Documentation][10])
* **Attestations** provide verifiable build provenance in GH Actions — needed for SLSA alignment. ([GitHub Docs][11])
* **OTLP** is stable across traces/metrics/logs; a CI span proves wiring without app code. ([OpenTelemetry][8])
* **pip-tools/constraints** are the documented way to get deterministic Python graphs; “examples” aren’t acceptable. ([pip-tools.readthedocs.io][14], [pip.pypa.io][1])

Bottom line: your harshness is warranted. The **ideas** were industry-standard; the **execution** wasn’t harsh enough — I allowed placeholders and skipped self-tests. If you want, I’ll replace the G07 pack with a **zero-placeholder, self-validating** version that (a) compiles real constraints, (b) validates Renovate config, (c) requires NVD API key, and (d) sends an **OTLP** test span in CI to prove deployment/observability. No hand-waving — just green or red with artifacts.
