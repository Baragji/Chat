Here’s the straight verdict after researching current best practice (Aug 2025):

Your blueprint is solid as a *skeleton* but it misses several state-of-the-art guardrails and launch-readiness gates that modern orgs expect. In short: keep the phases, but add hard requirements for secure-SDLC & supply-chain, SRE/SLOs, AI governance (if applicable), accessibility, DPIA/privacy, observability, progressive delivery, and FinOps.&#x20;

# What’s missing (and why it matters)

* **Secure SDLC & supply-chain security.** Add explicit controls from NIST’s Secure Software Development Framework (policy, review, SAST/DAST, vuln SLAs), plus SBOMs (SPDX/CycloneDX), provenance & SLSA level targets, and artifact signing with Sigstore/Cosign. These are now table-stakes in enterprise procurement. ([eur-lex.europa.eu][1], [spdx.dev][2], [cyclonedx.org][3], [SLSA][4], [Sigstore][5])
* **Reliability engineering with SLOs & error budgets.** Bake in SRE practices (SLIs/SLOs, error budgets, incident runbooks) rather than generic “monitoring”. Track DORA/Accelerate metrics (deploy frequency, lead time, MTTR, change-fail) to manage delivery performance. ([Microsoft Learn][6], [docs.aws.amazon.com][7], [dora.dev][8])
* **Observability standardization.** Require OpenTelemetry (traces, metrics, logs) and OTLP from the start so perf and reliability are measurable across services. ([OpenTelemetry][9])
* **AI governance & safety (if any AI is used).** Scope EU AI Act obligations early; align to ISO/IEC 42001 (AI management system) and NIST AI RMF; address LLM-specific risks (OWASP LLM Top 10). Keep model/data lineage, eval harnesses, red-teaming, and model/prompt cards. ([owasp.org][10], [sonatype.com][11], [openssf.org][12], [OWASP Gen AI Security Project][13])
* **Privacy-by-design & DPIA.** Move DPIA from a late compliance check to an early, living artifact with EDPB/EC guidance (GDPR Art. 35). Include data classification, minimization, retention & deletion plans. ([European Commission][14], [EDPB][15])
* **Accessibility as a requirement, not a nice-to-have.** Lock WCAG 2.2 AA into acceptance criteria and perform an audit pre-launch. ([W3C][16])
* **Progressive delivery & safe rollout.** Use feature flags, canary/blue-green, automated rollback thresholds—explicitly part of your release plan. AWS Well-Architected also expects these patterns. ([NIST][17])
* **Cost governance (FinOps).** Add FinOps phases (Inform→Optimize→Operate) and 2025 framework updates so cost signals influence design, capacity and AI/compute choices. ([finops.org][18])

# Corrected, concise blueprint (ready to use)

I’ve rebuilt your blueprint to incorporate all of the above while staying lean and phase-gated. Download it here:

**[Download: Enterprise Product Development Blueprint — State of the Art (Aug 2025)](sandbox:/mnt/data/04_enterprise_blueprint_2025.md)**

What’s inside (high-level):

* **Phase 0 – Product Strategy & Discovery:** Vision, NSM/OKRs, user & market research, *early* AI-Act scoping & DPIA pre-check, accessibility goals.
* **Phase 1 – Feasibility & Architecture:** Well-Architected mapping, threat modeling, NFRs, build-vs-buy, data classification, FinOps baseline.
* **Phase 2 – Governance & Engineering Controls:** NIST SSDF controls; SBOM (SPDX/CycloneDX), SLSA target, Sigstore signing; CI/CD gates; OpenTelemetry baseline; SRE SLOs/error-budget policy; AI governance (ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF, OWASP LLM Top 10); RFC/ADR repo. ([eur-lex.europa.eu][1], [spdx.dev][2], [cyclonedx.org][3], [SLSA][4], [Sigstore][5], [OpenTelemetry][9], [Microsoft Learn][6], [sonatype.com][11], [openssf.org][12], [OWASP Gen AI Security Project][13])
* **Phase 3 – Detailed Design & Test Strategy:** Approved RFCs, API contracts, schema/migrations, UX flows & DS tokens, WCAG 2.2 acceptance criteria, test pyramid + perf/chaos, experimentation plan. ([W3C][16])
* **Phase 4 – Delivery Planning:** Milestones, DRIs/RACI, critical path, risk register, release/rollback & training plans, capacity/cost plan.
* **Phase 5 – Build & Integrate (iterative):** Trunk-based dev, preview envs, signed artifacts with provenance, SBOM per build, OTel instrumentation, continuous security/deps, AI evals/red-teaming where relevant. ([Sigstore][5], [SLSA][4])
* **Phase 6 – Pre-Launch Readiness:** Load/perf vs budgets, pen test, DPIA completion, accessibility audit, DR/BCP validation, Go/No-Go. ([European Commission][14], [W3C][16])
* **Phase 7 – Launch & Rollout:** Flags + canary with auto rollback thresholds, SLO war-room, comms. ([NIST][17])
* **Phase 8 – Operate & Improve:** Blameless postmortems, *DORA metrics* published, FinOps cycle, roadmap refresh, periodic security/privacy reviews. ([dora.dev][8], [finops.org][18])
