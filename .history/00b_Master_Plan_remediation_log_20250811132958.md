# Master Plan Remediation Log
> Role: Live status & decisions log. Canonical tools: see `03_Catalog_of_tools.md`. Canonical risks: see `01_ai_dev_pitfalls.md`. Blueprint: `00_complete_entreprise_development_consolidate_state-of-the-art_plan_before_extensive:w0-w9_reserch.md`.
**Date Range:** Research Phase through Phase 0 Implementation  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive record of all established research, agreements, and implementation decisions

---

## **1. TLDR (3 Sentences)**

After 5 previous AI project failures, extensive multi-AI research established a Phase-based approach: Phase -1 (meta-planning research), Phase 0 (guardrails infrastructure), Phase 1 (AI coding system implementation). Current status is mid-Phase 0 where we halted custom guardrail development and pivoted to Composer-First + Docker-First approach using industry-standard tools (Gitleaks, Semgrep, TruffleHog, etc.) instead of building from scratch. The core insight is that infrastructure/guardrails must be established BEFORE the AI coding system to prevent repeating previous failure patterns.

### **üîß CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**

#### **Guardrails Inventory & Prioritization:**
```markdown
DEPENDENCY-FIRST APPROACH ESTABLISHED:

COMPLETED GUARDRAILS:
‚úÖ G00: State Management System
‚úÖ G01: Mock Detection Framework  
‚úÖ G02: Secrets Scanning (TruffleHog/Gitleaks)
‚úÖ G03: Package Verification System
‚úÖ G04: Mutation Testing Framework

PRIORITY 2 (READY):
üéØ G07: Emergency Dependency Management (DevOps plan complete)

PRIORITY 7 (PREPARED):
üìã G06: SAST Security Scanning
```

#### **Multi-AI Workflow Established:**
```markdown
CURRENT WORKFLOW:
Technical Architect ‚Üí DevOps Engineer ‚Üí Master Coordinator ‚Üí Task Executor ‚Üí Zero Trust Validator

ROLES DEFINED:
- Technical Architect: Requirements analysis and solution design
- DevOps Engineer: Implementation planning and CI/CD setup  
- Master Coordinator: Task delegation and workflow management
- Task Executor: Actual implementation work
- Zero Trust Validator: Quality assurance and compliance checking
```

#### **State Management System Implemented:**
```markdown
STATE FILES LOCATION: .zencoder/state/
- phase0-guardrails-progress.json: Tracks guardrail completion status
- current-priority.json: Manages implementation queue
- dependency-map.json: Maps guardrail interdependencies
- quality-metrics.json: Tracks implementation quality scores
```

### **üö® CRITICAL COURSE CORRECTION APPLIED**

#### **Problem Identified:**
**Date:** Current session  
**Issue:** Phase 0 implementation was violating Composer-First principle by building custom solutions instead of integrating industry-standard tools

**Evidence of Deviation:**
```markdown
WHAT WE WERE DOING (INCORRECT):
‚ùå Writing custom business_rules.py validators
‚ùå Building custom mock_detector.py scripts
‚ùå Creating custom verify_packages.py from scratch  
‚ùå Manual CI/CD workflow construction

WHAT WE SHOULD DO (CORRECTED):
‚úÖ Use Gitleaks v8.18.0 for secrets scanning
‚úÖ Use Semgrep with --config=auto for SAST
‚úÖ Use TruffleHog v3.63.2 for comprehensive secrets detection
‚úÖ Use mutmut for mutation testing
‚úÖ Dockerize all tools from beginning
```

#### **Solution Applied:**
**Docker-First + Composer-First Approach:**
```yaml
# Example corrected approach:
version: '3.8'
services:
  gitleaks:
    image: zricethezav/gitleaks:v8.18.0
    volumes: [".:/repo"]
    command: detect --source . --verbose
    
  semgrep:
    image: semgrep/semgrep:1.50.0  
    volumes: [".:/src"]
    command: --config=auto --error .
```

**Implementation Process Corrected:**
1. Research official Docker images for each guardrail tool
2. Add to docker-compose.guardrails.yml with exact versions
3. docker-compose run <service> to test
4. Minimal configuration (usually one config file)
5. CI integration using same containers

### **üí∞ BUDGET & RESOURCE FRAMEWORK**

#### **Financial Constraints Established:**
```markdown
BUDGET ALLOCATION:
- Total Available: $500
- Planned Spend: $300  
- Buffer: $200
- Weekly Breakdown:
  * Week 1: Foundation Setup ($0)
  * Week 2: AI Workforce Testing ($150)
  * Week 3: Methodology Setup ($0) 
  * Week 4: Quality Framework ($0)
  * Week 5: Pilot Project ($100)
  * Week 6: Validation ($50)
```

#### **Cost Tracking Requirements:**
- Live token spend tracking with CSV logging
- Different vendor requirement for primary/fallback models
- Weekly cost monitoring and projection  
- Hard budget ceiling with automatic shutoffs
- Cost notes required in all PRs

### **üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA ESTABLISHED**

#### **Phase 0 Success Metrics:**
```markdown
GUARDRAIL COVERAGE:
- >90% of 20-point framework implemented
- All Priority 1 guardrails operational
- Zero "garbage veiled in diamonds" incidents  
- Docker-first containerization complete
- CI/CD pipeline functional

QUALITY GATES:
- All tools tested and validated
- Configuration files properly managed
- Documentation complete for each guardrail
- Integration testing passed
```

#### **Phase 1 Success Metrics:**
```markdown
AI SYSTEM PERFORMANCE:
- 95% of projects pass all quality gates
- Zero production failures due to AI code
- <90 seconds average generation time
- Complete audit trail for all AI decisions
- Business logic validation in plain English
```

### **üìö KEY INSIGHTS CAPTURED**

#### **Critical Realizations:**
1. **Infrastructure Before Intelligence:** Guardrails must exist before AI agents to prevent failure patterns
2. **Composer-First Principle:** Use proven industry tools, never build custom when standard exists  
3. **Docker-First Approach:** Containerization eliminates "works on my machine" and dependency hell
4. **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Single AI models fail; adversarial validation catches errors
5. **Business Context Saturation:** AI must be flooded with business rules to prevent logic bypass

#### **Failure Pattern Prevention:**
```markdown
LESSONS FROM 5 PREVIOUS FAILURES:
- Premature solution-jumping without proper planning
- Lack of systematic validation frameworks
- Custom solutions instead of industry standards
- Missing business logic validation
- No adversarial testing approach
- Insufficient context management
- Environment inconsistency issues
```

#### **Research-Backed Decisions:**
- TDD as "machine-enforced lockbox" not just testing
- Context saturation strategy for business logic alignment
- Graduated autonomy implementation path
- Multi-phase validation (pre, during, post, continuous)
- Specification-first pipeline approach

### **üîÆ NEXT STEPS DEFINED**

#### **Immediate Actions (Phase 0 Completion):**
1. Complete G07 implementation using Docker + industry tools
2. Validate all completed guardrails in containerized environment
3. Establish docker-compose.guardrails.yml as single execution point
4. Complete CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
5. Document Phase 0 completion criteria

#### **Phase 1 Preparation:**
1. Set up CrewAI multi-agent architecture
2. Configure business context package auto-injection
3. Implement token tracking and budget monitoring
4. Establish adversarial testing protocols
5. Create pilot project for validation

#### **Long-term Strategic Goals:**
- Scale to 50 projects/month within 6 months
- Achieve 10 paying customers within 3 months  
- Maintain zero security incidents
- Enable complete non-technical founder autonomy
