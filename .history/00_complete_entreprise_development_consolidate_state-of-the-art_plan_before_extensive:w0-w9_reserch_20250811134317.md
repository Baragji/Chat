> Role: Canonical blueprint (architecture, stages, workflow). Tools catalog lives in `03_Catalog_of_tools.md`. Risk register lives in `01_ai_dev_pitfalls.md`. Live status/decisions in `00b_Master_Plan_remediation_log.md`.

Understood. I'll conduct a comprehensive search for the most current, state-of-the-art practices for building an AI-driven code quality system as of August 2025. I'll then compile an enhanced and final version of the checklist, toolchain, and workflow based on both your prior requests and the latest findings. I'll start researching now.

Below is a consolidated and up‑to‑date (August 2025) “state‑of‑the‑art” plan for building an autonomous AI‑driven coding system with enterprise‑grade quality, security and compliance.  This version integrates the earlier GPT‑4.1 checklist, Claude’s enhancements and additional tools/practices discovered in 2025 research.  It treats each pull‑request/commit as untrusted, layering automated checks, multiple AI models and human oversight.

---

## 1  Foundation & Governance

* **Zero‑trust architecture** – treat all code as hostile until proven safe; require signed commits and enforce branch‑protection and conventional‑commit rules.
* **Immutable audit trail & supply‑chain security** – log every agent/LLM action with cryptographic integrity; adopt SLSA Level 3+ provenance and image‑signing for all builds.
* **Multi‑model AI validation** – require at least three different LLMs (e.g., GPT‑4o, Claude 4, Gemini Pro 1.5) to review every change; cross‑validate their feedback.
* **Compliance frameworks** – bake SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA checks into policies.
* **Escalation triggers & external audits** – automatically flag high‑risk PRs for human review; schedule quarterly external penetration tests/red‑team exercises.

## 2  Pre‑Commit (Local)

* **Pre‑commit hooks** running Ruff, Black, isort, docformatter and autoflake.
* Mandatory **git‑signing** of every commit.
* Verify commit messages follow **Conventional Commits** and enforce branch naming rules.

## 3  Stage 1 – Code Quality & Style (blocking)

* **Formatting & Linting:** Ruff (with flake8, bandit, pydocstyle, import‑sorting), Black, isort, docformatter, autoflake, Flake8 plug‑ins, Xenon for complexity.
* **Lightweight refactoring assistants:** Sourcery provides on‑the‑fly refactoring suggestions in IDEs; it runs locally for privacy and improves readability.
* **Automated whole‑repo review:** Zencoder analyzes entire repositories, understands architectural intent and suggests fixes before human review.
## 4  Stage 2 – Type Safety & Static Analysis (blocking)

* **Type checkers:** MyPy (strict), Pyright and Pyre catch different edge‑cases; Pylint and Vulture detect unused code; Radon and Xenon enforce complexity limits.
* **Static analyzers:** Semgrep, Bandit and Snyk Code (commercial) plus CodeQL for deeper semantic analysis.
* **Container & runtime scanning:** Trivy, Grype and Clair for image vulnerabilities; Falco and Sysdig for runtime threat detection.
* **IaC scanning:** Checkov and TFSec; Spacelift orchestrates and enforces policy‑as‑code across Terraform/Pulumi.
* **Secret detection:** TruffleHog, Gitleaks and detect‑secrets; CodeAnt.ai scans commits and infrastructure simultaneously, flags misconfigurations and offers automatic fixes.
* **Security platforms:** HackerOne Code scans commits for OWASP Top 10 issues and produces compliance reports.

## 6  Stage 4 – Dependency & License Management (blocking)

* **Automated updates:** Dependabot or Renovate to keep dependencies fresh.
* **License compliance:** pip‑licenses, FOSSA and Black Duck; require SBOM generation via CycloneDX.
* **Vulnerability databases:** Safety and Snyk Open Source.

## 7  Stage 5 – Architecture & Design Validation (blocking)

* **UML & dependency graphs:** Pyreverse, Graphviz, pydeps.
* **Cohesion & coupling analysis:** cohesion library; ADR (architectural decision record) validation.
* **AI‑aided reviewers:** Zencoder and CodeRabbit provide context‑aware suggestions; CodeRabbit posts annotations in PRs and remembers prior decisions.

## 8  Stage 6 – Testing & Coverage (blocking)

* **Unit & Integration:** pytest with pytest‑cov; pytest‑xdist for parallel execution; property‑based testing via Hypothesis.
* **Performance & load:** pytest‑benchmark, Locust, k6 and Artillery for load tests; memory\_profiler for memory profiling; QuickCheck (port) for property tests.
* **Contract testing:** pact‑python for API contracts.
* **Mutation testing:** mutmut and cosmic‑ray ensure tests catch defects.
* **Chaos engineering & resilience:** Chaos Monkey or Gremlin to inject faults; litmus for Kubernetes.
* **Visual regression (UI)** when applicable: integrate tools like Playwright’s screenshot comparison.

## 9  Stage 7 – AI‑Specific Validation (blocking)

* **Semantic & logical consistency:** tools that perform data‑flow and control‑flow analysis to confirm that code implements intended business logic; frameworks like Zencoder and CodeRabbit already provide some of this capability.
* **Test adequacy & performance impact:** measure whether tests cover new logic; detect performance regressions and memory leaks with Valgrind or memory\_profiler.
* **Originality & plagiarism:** check that generated code isn’t copied from existing repositories to avoid licensing issues.

## 10  Stage 8 – Build & Containerization (blocking)

* **Docker best practices:** multi‑stage builds with minimal base images; enforce base‑image pinning.
* **Dockerfile linting:** hadolint.
* **Image scanning & signing:** Trivy, Grype, Clair; sign images using cosign/notary; generate provenance attestations (SLSA).
* **Reproducible builds:** Nix or Bazel; pinned versions and hashed dependencies.

## 11  Stage 9 – Infrastructure‑as‑Code Validation (blocking)

* **IaC security:** Checkov, TFSec, Terragrunt; OPA/Gatekeeper for policy enforcement.
* **Drift detection & orchestration:** Spacelift coordinates Terraform/Pulumi runs, enforces OPA policies and detects drift.

## 12  Stage 10 – Dynamic & Runtime Validation (monitored)

* **DAST:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite Enterprise and Checkmarx DAST for dynamic web‑application scanning.
* **Load & performance:** Locust, k6, Artillery; continuous profiling via Pyroscope or Parca.
* **Chaos engineering & resilience testing:** Chaos Monkey, Gremlin, Litmus.
* **Runtime security:** Falco, Sysdig monitor containers for malicious behaviour; ThreadSanitizer or AddressSanitizer for concurrency and memory issues.

## 13  Stage 11 – Documentation & Compliance (blocking)

* **Documentation:** Sphinx or MkDocs with docstring‑coverage enforcement; auto‑generate API docs via OpenAPI/Swagger.
* **Architecture diagrams:** adopt the C4 model; generate diagrams automatically.
* **Compliance automation:** integrate tools like IriusRisk or Security Compass to map threats and controls; enforce GDPR/PII scanning; maintain up‑to‑date SBOMs.

## 14  Observability & Monitoring

* **Structured logging & tracing:** structlog, OpenTelemetry; centralised logging with the ELK/EFK stack.
* **Metrics & dashboards:** Prometheus + Grafana; Datadog/New Relic for application metrics and APM.
* **Error tracking:** Sentry for exceptions; integrate alerts into Slack/Teams.
* **Audit logs:** store logs in immutable storage (e.g., Amazon S3 with Glacier) and hash them for tamper detection.

## 16  Step‑by‑Step Workflow (2025)

1. **Bootstrap (Weeks 1‑2).** Design a monorepo with strict separation of agents, core libraries, API layers and tests; set up branch protection (signed commits, required status checks) and configure a comprehensive `pyproject.toml` with Ruff, MyPy and coverage rules.
2. **Pre‑commit.** Local hooks run style, lint and type checks; commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits standard and be signed.
3. **CI on PR creation.** The pipeline runs the entire stack: lint/format (Ruff, Black), static analysis (MyPy, Pyright, Pylint, CodeQL), SAST (Bandit, Semgrep, Snyk Code), secrets (TruffleHog/Gitleaks), SCA (Safety, pip‑audit), container/IaC scanning (Trivy, Grype, Clair, Checkov, TFSec), dependency updates (Dependabot/Renovate), architecture checks (import‑linter, Pyreverse), documentation coverage, unit/integration tests (pytest) with coverage enforcement, property/fuzz tests (Hypothesis), performance tests (pytest‑benchmark), mutation tests (mutmut/cosmic‑ray), contract tests (pact), chaos simulations if applicable, and license compliance.
4. **AI review.** Multi‑LLM review step triggers GPT‑4o, Claude 4, Gemini Pro 1.5 and optionally CodeT5/CodeBERT.  Use a cross‑validator to require at least two LLMs to agree; failing or conflicting reviews trigger escalation.
5. **AI‑specific validation.** Run anti‑pattern detection, semantic consistency analysis and test adequacy evaluation; measure performance regressions and memory leaks.
6. **Human escalation.** Any PR flagged as high‑risk or with single‑critical LLM dissent must be manually reviewed.  Escalate to external auditors for unresolved issues.
7. **Merge.** Only allowed if all checks pass and at least two LLM reviewers approve.
8. **Post‑merge & periodic.** Nightly/weekly full scans run SAST/DAST/IAST (e.g., SonarQube, Qodana, Checkmarx), container runtime monitoring, supply‑chain attestation and external mutation testing.  Rotate AI reviewers regularly and schedule quarterly external audits.  Continuously monitor performance, security and compliance metrics; update the SBOM and audit logs.

**Summary:**  Compared with the original 2024 answer, this August 2025 plan adds container and runtime security scanning (Trivy, Grype, Clair, Falco), IaC scanning (Checkov, TFSec, Spacelift), dynamic application testing (OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite), software‑composition analysis, AI‑specific validators, advanced testing (performance, chaos, contract, visual regression), supply‑chain governance and new AI‑powered review tools like **Zencoder**, **CodeRabbit**, **CodeScene**, **Sourcery**, **HackerOne Code** and **CodeAnt.ai**.  Implementing the above layered pipeline—with continuous monitoring, multiple AI reviewers and human checkpoints—represents the current state‑of‑the‑art for achieving enterprise‑grade quality and security in an autonomous AI coding system.
