Gate G-1: ‚úÖ Research complete; failure patterns mapped; methodology validated by multi-AI consensus.

Phase 0 ‚Äî AI-Proof Guardrails Infrastructure (IN PROGRESS üîÑ)
Duration: 2-3 weeks
Goals: Build zero-trust validation layer BEFORE deploying AI agents.

Core Infrastructure (Composer-First)
Container orchestration: docker-compose.guardrails.yml with pinned tool versions
Secrets management: Gitleaks v8.18.0 + TruffleHog v3.63.2 (G02)
Security scanning: Semgrep + Bandit with --config=auto (G06)
Dependency safety: pip-audit + Safety with Renovate automation (G07)
Code quality: Ruff + Black + isort + complexity gates (G01)
Testing validation: mutmut + Hypothesis property testing (G04, G05)
Package verification: pip-tools resolution with hash verification (G03)
Non-Technical Founder Dashboard
State tracking: .zencoder/state/ JSON files for progress monitoring
Quality metrics: Composite scores per guardrail with red/green status
Cost tracking: Real-time token spend with budget alerts
Risk monitoring: Live violation counts mapped to your 19 pitfall categories
AI-Specific Controls
Business context injection: Auto-append your 10 non-negotiable rules to every AI prompt
Multi-model validation: Require 2/3 AI consensus (Builder/Auditor/Saboteur)
Hallucination detection: Package existence verification before code generation
Logic bypass prevention: Mandatory property-based test generation for business rules
Gate G0: All Priority 1 guardrails operational; Docker containers tested; non-tech monitoring dashboard functional.

Phase 1 ‚Äî AI Agent Architecture & Deployment (PLANNED ‚è≥)
Duration: 1-2 weeks
Goals: Deploy CrewAI multi-agent system with enterprise-grade oversight.

Agent Configuration (CrewAI Framework)
agents:
  planner:
    model: "gemini-flash"  # Cost-optimized planning
    role: "Requirements analysis & task breakdown"

  builder:
    model: "gpt-4o-mini"  # Primary coding agent
    role: "Code generation with business context saturation"

  auditor:
    model: "claude-sonnet"  # Logic validation specialist  
    role: "Business rule compliance & security review"

  saboteur:
    model: "gemini-flash"  # Adversarial testing
    role: "Edge case discovery & failure injection"
Enterprise-Grade Agent Controls
Trace & provenance: OpenTelemetry instrumentation on every agent action
Cost governance: Per-agent token budgets with automatic shutoffs
Quality gates: Agents cannot proceed without passing all guardrails
Audit trail: Cryptographic logging of every decision with business justification
Rollback capability: Automatic revert if composite quality score <85%
Non-Technical Oversight Mechanisms
Plain English explanations: Every code change must pass "Explain Like I'm Five" gate
Business logic validation: Agents must confirm business rule compliance in natural language
Escalation triggers: High-risk changes automatically pause for human review
Success metrics: Real-time dashboard showing project completion rates vs quality gates
Gate G1: Multi-agent system deployed; enterprise logging active; non-tech oversight dashboard operational.

Phase 2 ‚Äî Autonomous Production Pipeline (PLANNED)
Duration: Ongoing iterations
Goals: Fully autonomous project generation with enterprise-grade safety.

Continuous Integration (AI-Driven)
Trunk-based development: AI agents commit to main with mandatory PR gates
Automated testing: Property-based + mutation testing generated by Saboteur agent
Progressive deployment: Feature flags with canary rollout (even for generated projects)
Continuous monitoring: DORA metrics tracked (deploy freq, lead time, MTTR, change-fail rate)
Supply Chain Security (AI-Aware)
SBOM generation: CycloneDX bills-of-material for every generated project
Artifact signing: Sigstore/Cosign signatures on all AI-generated code
Provenance attestation: SLSA Level 3 attestations linking code to specific AI agents
Vulnerability management: Automated dependency updates with compatibility verification
Business Metrics & FinOps
Revenue tracking: $50/successful project with quality gate enforcement
Cost optimization: AI model routing based on task complexity vs token costs
Capacity planning: Burst compute projections for high-demand periods
Economic validation: Profit margin enforcement (70% target) with automatic project rejection
Gate G2: Autonomous pipeline operational; security posture enterprise-grade; business metrics positive.

Phase 3 ‚Äî Scale & Continuous Improvement
Duration: Continuous operation
Goals: Maintain quality while scaling to 50 projects/month.

Advanced AI Governance
Model drift detection: Quality degradation alerts when AI performance drops
Red team exercises: Quarterly adversarial testing of entire AI workforce
Bias & fairness monitoring: Automated checks for discriminatory code patterns
Safety guardrails: EU AI Act compliance monitoring (if applicable)
Enterprise Operations
Incident response: Blameless postmortems with AI agent behavior analysis
Compliance automation: SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA checks integrated into quality gates
Disaster recovery: Complete AI agent state backup with <4hr recovery time
Knowledge management: Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) auto-generated by AI
Non-Technical Founder Success Metrics
Zero manual intervention: <1 hour/week human oversight requirement
Quality maintenance: >95% projects pass all gates without human review
Financial performance: Consistent 70%+ gross margins with predictable costs
Risk management: Zero security incidents; zero production failures from AI code
Gate G3: Enterprise-scale operation; full automation achieved; founder autonomy preserved.

Key Adaptations for Your Scenario
Instead of Human Teams:
AI agent roles replace traditional dev team functions
Multi-model consensus replaces peer code review
Automated quality gates replace manual QA processes
Business context saturation replaces product manager input
Non-Technical Founder Safeguards:
Plain English explanations for all AI decisions
Red/green dashboards instead of technical metrics
Automatic escalation for complex decisions
Economic circuit breakers to prevent runaway costs
Enterprise Standards Maintained:
Zero-trust validation of all AI-generated code
Cryptographic audit trails for compliance
Supply chain security with SBOMs and signing
Progressive deployment with automated rollback
Success Criteria Tailored to Your Business Model
Phase 0 Success: All 20 guardrails operational with <5% false positive rate
Phase 1 Success: AI agents generating profitable projects with 78% success rate
Phase 2 Success: Full autonomy with <1 hour/week human intervention
Scale Success: 50 projects/month at 70% gross margin with zero security incidents

This blueprint maintains enterprise rigor while acknowledging your unique constraints: non-technical oversight, AI-first development, and tight budget controls.
