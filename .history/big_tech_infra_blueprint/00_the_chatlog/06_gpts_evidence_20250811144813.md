Got it. I’ve produced the **red-line delta** and an **updated blueprint** that mirrors your actual plan (Phase −1/0/1, Composer-First, CrewAI roles, pinned tools, budget caps, inline mapping). Downloads below, followed by the evidence.

# Why these changes are correct (with evidence)

* **Keep SSDF as the secure-SDLC backbone.** NIST’s SP 800-218 is the U.S. reference model for integrating security across *any* SDLC, and NIST has released an AI-specific augmentation (SP 800-218A IPD) to fold model risks into the same controls. That’s exactly what an AI-first team needs. ([csrc.nist.gov][1], [nvlpubs.nist.gov][2])
* **Supply-chain integrity (SLSA + signing) is baseline, not gold-plating.** SLSA is the industry framework for provenance; **Cosign/Sigstore** provides widely adopted signing and verification (including keyless/OIDC). These directly stop tampering between build and deploy. ([SLSA][3], [Sigstore][4], [GitHub][5])
* **Pin container digests to guarantee immutability.** Moving from `:latest` tags to `image@sha256:…` is standard modern guidance for reproducible, tamper-resistant builds; we enforce it in the compose runner and CI. (Backed by the same SLSA/Sigstore guidance above.) ([SLSA][6], [Sigstore][7])
* **Observability via OpenTelemetry/OTLP should be mandatory.** OTLP is a stable, vendor-neutral protocol for traces/metrics/logs; making an OTLP smoke test a **blocking** gate ensures every increment is observable—critical when AI is doing most of the coding. ([OpenTelemetry][8])
* **Use DORA’s Four Keys to run with one human.** The research-backed Four Keys (deploy frequency, lead time, change-fail rate, MTTR) predict performance and provide a simple weekly health report you can approve without reading code. ([dora.dev][9], [Google Cloud][10])
* **Accessibility is table-stakes.** WCAG 2.2 is a W3C Recommendation; we put AA success criteria into acceptance tests and audit before major releases. ([W3C][11])
* **AI governance needs explicit human oversight.** If your product includes AI features, the **EU AI Act** requires human oversight (Art. 14) for high-risk systems, and **ISO/IEC 42001** + **NIST AI RMF** give you a management system and risk framework to operationalize that oversight. We also bake in **OWASP LLM Top-10** tests for LLM-specific risks. ([eur-lex.europa.eu][12], [ISO][13], [A-LIGN][14], [NIST][15], [owasp.org][16], [OWASP Gen AI Security Project][17])
* **Budget caps with FOCUS are enforceable, not aspirational.** FOCUS is the FinOps Foundation’s open, vendor-neutral billing schema used by major CSPs; wiring your **\$300 target / \$500 ceiling** to FOCUS data means CI can block merges/releases when forecasts breach policy. ([finops.org][18], [Focus FinOps][19])

# Proof this matches *your* plan

* **Phase labels & flow** now match **Phase −1 → 0 → 1** as defined in your remediation log, with Phase −1 complete and Phase 0 mid-implementation.&#x20;
* **Composer-First + Docker-First** is explicit, with a compose runner and **pinned versions** (Gitleaks v8.18.0, TruffleHog v3.63.2, Semgrep 1.50.0) carried from your course-correction.
* **CrewAI roles** (Planner → Builder → Auditor → Saboteur) are named, reflecting your adversarial trinity and framework choice.&#x20;
* **Budget policy** encodes your **\$300 target / \$500 ceiling** with weekly reviews and PR “Cost Notes.”&#x20;
* The blueprint **inlines the 19-pitfall → G01–G20** mapping so it’s self-contained, consistent with your catalog and mapping docs.

Want me to also pin **exact image digests** (sha256) for the tools you’ve listed and drop a CI workflow that enforces the budget gate and uploads a weekly DORA+FOCUS report?
