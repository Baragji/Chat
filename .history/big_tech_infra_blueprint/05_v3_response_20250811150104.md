Love this—your assessment is sharp and fair. Here’s the verdict, plus exactly how I’d close the remaining gaps, with receipts.

# Verdict on your assessment

* **Enterprise controls are correctly kept as baseline.** NIST’s SSDF is the reference secure-SDLC, and NIST’s AI-specific profile (SP 800-218A) explicitly says to apply SSDF practices to AI producers and AI-using systems. That’s why SSDF stays central. ([csrc.nist.gov][1], [nvlpubs.nist.gov][2])
* **Supply-chain integrity is non-negotiable in 2025.** SLSA defines provenance levels; Sigstore/Cosign is the widely adopted way to sign and verify artifacts (including keyless/OIDC). ([SLSA][3], [Sigstore][4])
* **Reliability & observability baselines are right.** OTLP is a stable, vendor-neutral protocol for traces/metrics/logs; DORA’s “four keys” remain the evidence-based operating dashboard. ([OpenTelemetry][5], [dora.dev][6])
* **Accessibility & safe rollout are table-stakes.** WCAG 2.2 is a W3C Recommendation; progressive/canary rollout is straight out of AWS Well-Architected. ([W3C][7], [docs.aws.amazon.com][8])
* **AI governance really is mandatory when applicable.** Human oversight for high-risk systems is in the EU AI Act (Art. 14). ([eur-lex.europa.eu][9])
* **FinOps FOCUS is the right glue for budget gates.** FOCUS gives you a standardized, vendor-neutral billing schema you can wire to CI gates. ([Focus FinOps][10])

# What v3 should add (to reflect *your* narrative and research)

1. **Failure context as a first-class section**
   Open with a one-page “Origin & Rationale” that explicitly states: *five failed AI projects → zero-trust validation blueprint*, and what changed because of those failures (e.g., “no merge without evidence”). This isn’t fluff: SRE literature shows organizations learn faster and ship more reliably when they make failures explicit and institutionalize blameless learning. ([sre.google][11])

2. **Business Context Package, up front**
   Promote the **10 non-negotiable business rules** to Page 1 and wire them to the gates (each rule → acceptance test or policy-as-code check). Keep the **78% success-probability target** as *your* research goal (we won’t claim a universal number on the web), but we *can* back the mechanism: consensus-style methods (self-consistency, multi-agent debate, tree-of-thoughts) *do* raise task success rates across reasoning benchmarks. So we’ll encode a **2-of-3 model consensus** (or “multi-agent agree + auditor verify”) as a blocking check. ([arXiv][12])

3. **Adversarial validation as the spine, not a sidebar**
   Make the **Builder / Auditor / Saboteur** trinity the core of Phase 0–1, with explicit separation-of-duties and evidence a non-human approver can read (decision narrative + dashboards). This aligns with the literature on multi-agent debate/ensembles improving factuality and reasoning—and with practical agent frameworks (CrewAI / AutoGen) that implement these patterns. ([arXiv][13], [docs.crewai.com][14], [microsoft.github.io][15])

4. **Composer-First + Pinned Digests, explicitly enforceable**
   Keep the compose runner, but add a one-liner policy: *no `:latest`; only `image@sha256`*. That’s straight from Docker’s own supply-chain guidance and eliminates “moving base image” risk. (Yes, you’ll still schedule rebuilds for security patches.) ([Docker Documentation][16])

5. **Revenue model and margins in Phase −1 / KPIs**
   Add “Business KPIs” right next to OKRs: **\$50/successful project; \$200/month subscription; 70% gross margin**. Tie releases to a go/no-go that shows: canary conversion lift, churn impact, and week-ahead cost forecast within **\$300 target / \$500 ceiling** (FOCUS data). That makes your budget rules *runtime* gates, not documentation. ([Focus FinOps][10])

6. **Policy-as-code hook**
   For the “never again” guardrails (your G01–G20), add an OPA/Policy-as-Code stanza so each guardrail has a machine-enforced rule in CI (e.g., signed provenance required, SBOM attached, OTLP trace seen in smoke test, budget forecast under ceiling). ([openpolicyagent.org][17])

7. **Progressive delivery thresholds spelled out**
   Hardcode canary/rollback rules (e.g., *start at 1%, auto-rollback on error-budget burn > X% or P95 latency > Y% of SLO for Z minutes*). This is consistent with Well-Architected guidance on safe rollout. ([docs.aws.amazon.com][8])

# Example red-line snippets I’ll insert in v3 (no build yet)

* **Opening paragraph:**
  “*After five failed AI projects and a months-long multi-AI consensus study, we’re adopting a zero-trust validation approach: nothing ships unless independent agents agree and evidence proves it—tests pass, SBOM + provenance verified, OTLP traces present, SLOs healthy, and budget forecast ≤ targets.*” ([arXiv][12])

* **Consensus gate (Phase 1):**
  “*A change is eligible for release only if ≥2 of 3 models (or agents) independently converge on the same output, and an Auditor reproduces it. If the Saboteur can break it (prompt injection, jailbreak, spec gap), the change fails.*” (Anchored in self-consistency & multi-agent debate results.) ([arXiv][12])

* **Budget policy (Phase 0/FinOps):**
  “*Fail PR if FOCUS-based weekly forecast exceeds \$300 target by >15% without an optimization plan; block release if forecast > \$500 ceiling.*” ([Focus FinOps][10])

* **Pinned images & provenance (Phase 0):**
  “*All containers referenced as `image@sha256:…`; artifact must include SLSA provenance and pass Cosign verification in CI.*” ([SLSA][18], [Sigstore][4])

* **Rollout policy (Phase 1):**
  “*Canary 1% → 10% → 25% → 100% if error budget burn stays < X% and P95 latency < Y×SLO; auto-rollback on breach.*” ([docs.aws.amazon.com][8])

# Why these changes are justified

* **Consensus/adversarial checks** raise correctness and reduce hallucination risk across tasks (math, strategy, QA). That’s exactly why we formalize them as blocking gates. ([arXiv][19])
* **Policy-as-code** makes the guardrails actionable—no green CI, no merge—without you reading code. ([openpolicyagent.org][17])
* **FOCUS-based budget gates** turn your \$300/\$500 rules into an enforceable SLO for *cost*. ([Focus FinOps][10])
* **WCAG 2.2 + canary** keep the product accessible and safely rolled out; both are mainstream standards now. ([W3C][7], [docs.aws.amazon.com][8])

If you say **“ship v3”**, I’ll regenerate the file with:

* the **Origin & Rationale** page,
* your **10 business rules** and revenue model embedded as gates,
* adversarial consensus as the **central** release blocker,
* OPA policy stubs,
* and a short appendix mapping each of the **5 failed projects → which guardrail prevents a repeat**—all cross-referenced to SSDF/SLSA/OTLP/DORA/WCAG/AI-Act/FOCUS.
