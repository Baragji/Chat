Love this—your assessment is sharp and fair. Here’s the verdict, plus exactly how I’d close the remaining gaps, with receipts.

# Verdict on your assessment

* **Enterprise controls are correctly kept as baseline.** NIST’s SSDF is the reference secure-SDLC, and NIST’s AI-specific profile (SP 800-218A) explicitly says to apply SSDF practices to AI producers and AI-using systems. That’s why SSDF stays central. ([csrc.nist.gov][1], [nvlpubs.nist.gov][2])
* **Supply-chain integrity is non-negotiable in 2025.** SLSA defines provenance levels; Sigstore/Cosign is the widely adopted way to sign and verify artifacts (including keyless/OIDC). ([SLSA][3], [Sigstore][4])
* **Reliability & observability baselines are right.** OTLP is a stable, vendor-neutral protocol for traces/metrics/logs; DORA’s “four keys” remain the evidence-based operating dashboard. ([OpenTelemetry][5], [dora.dev][6])
* **Accessibility & safe rollout are table-stakes.** WCAG 2.2 is a W3C Recommendation; progressive/canary rollout is straight out of AWS Well-Architected. ([W3C][7], [docs.aws.amazon.com][8])
* **AI governance really is mandatory when applicable.** Human oversight for high-risk systems is in the EU AI Act (Art. 14). ([eur-lex.europa.eu][9])
* **FinOps FOCUS is the right glue for budget gates.** FOCUS gives you a standardized, vendor-neutral billing schema you can wire to CI gates. ([Focus FinOps][10])

# What v3 should add (to reflect *your* narrative and research)

1. **Failure context as a first-class section**
   Open with a one-page “Origin & Rationale” that explicitly states: *five failed AI projects → zero-trust validation blueprint*, and what changed because of those failures (e.g., “no merge without evidence”). This isn’t fluff: SRE literature shows organizations learn faster and ship more reliably when they make failures explicit and institutionalize blameless learning. ([sre.google][11])

2. **Business Context Package, up front**
   Promote the **10 non-negotiable business rules** to Page 1 and wire them to the gates (each rule → acceptance test or policy-as-code check). Keep the **78% success-probability target** as *your* research goal (we won’t claim a universal number on the web), but we *can* back the mechanism: consensus-style methods (self-consistency, multi-agent debate, tree-of-thoughts) *do* raise task success rates across reasoning benchmarks. So we’ll encode a **2-of-3 model consensus** (or “multi-agent agree + auditor verify”) as a blocking check. ([arXiv][12])

3. **Adversarial validation as the spine, not a sidebar**
   Make the **Builder / Auditor / Saboteur** trinity the core of Phase 0–1, with explicit separation-of-duties and evidence a non-human approver can read (decision narrative + dashboards). This aligns with the literature on multi-agent debate/ensembles improving factuality and reasoning—and with practical agent frameworks (CrewAI / AutoGen) that implement these patterns. ([arXiv][13], [docs.crewai.com][14], [microsoft.github.io][15])

4. **Composer-First + Pinned Digests, explicitly enforceable**
   Keep the compose runner, but add a one-liner policy: *no `:latest`; only `image@sha256`*. That’s straight from Docker’s own supply-chain guidance and eliminates “moving base image” risk. (Yes, you’ll still schedule rebuilds for security patches.) ([Docker Documentation][16])

5. **Revenue model and margins in Phase −1 / KPIs**
   Add “Business KPIs” right next to OKRs: **\$50/successful project; \$200/month subscription; 70% gross margin**. Tie releases to a go/no-go that shows: canary conversion lift, churn impact, and week-ahead cost forecast within **\$300 target / \$500 ceiling** (FOCUS data). That makes your budget rules *runtime* gates, not documentation. ([Focus FinOps][10])

6. **Policy-as-code hook**
   For the “never again” guardrails (your G01–G20), add an OPA/Policy-as-Code stanza so each guardrail has a machine-enforced rule in CI (e.g., signed provenance required, SBOM attached, OTLP trace seen in smoke test, budget forecast under ceiling). ([openpolicyagent.org][17])

7. **Progressive delivery thresholds spelled out**
   Hardcode canary/rollback rules (e.g., *start at 1%, auto-rollback on error-budget burn > X% or P95 latency > Y% of SLO for Z minutes*). This is consistent with Well-Architected guidance on safe rollout. ([docs.aws.amazon.com][8])

# Example red-line snippets I’ll insert in v3 (no build yet)

* **Opening paragraph:**
  “*After five failed AI projects and a months-long multi-AI consensus study, we’re adopting a zero-trust validation approach: nothing ships unless independent agents agree and evidence proves it—tests pass, SBOM + provenance verified, OTLP traces present, SLOs healthy, and budget forecast ≤ targets.*” ([arXiv][12])

* **Consensus gate (Phase 1):**
  “*A change is eligible for release only if ≥2 of 3 models (or agents) independently converge on the same output, and an Auditor reproduces it. If the Saboteur can break it (prompt injection, jailbreak, spec gap), the change fails.*” (Anchored in self-consistency & multi-agent debate results.) ([arXiv][12])

* **Budget policy (Phase 0/FinOps):**
  “*Fail PR if FOCUS-based weekly forecast exceeds \$300 target by >15% without an optimization plan; block release if forecast > \$500 ceiling.*” ([Focus FinOps][10])

* **Pinned images & provenance (Phase 0):**
  “*All containers referenced as `image@sha256:…`; artifact must include SLSA provenance and pass Cosign verification in CI.*” ([SLSA][18], [Sigstore][4])

* **Rollout policy (Phase 1):**
  “*Canary 1% → 10% → 25% → 100% if error budget burn stays < X% and P95 latency < Y×SLO; auto-rollback on breach.*” ([docs.aws.amazon.com][8])

# Why these changes are justified

* **Consensus/adversarial checks** raise correctness and reduce hallucination risk across tasks (math, strategy, QA). That’s exactly why we formalize them as blocking gates. ([arXiv][19])
* **Policy-as-code** makes the guardrails actionable—no green CI, no merge—without you reading code. ([openpolicyagent.org][17])
* **FOCUS-based budget gates** turn your \$300/\$500 rules into an enforceable SLO for *cost*. ([Focus FinOps][10])
* **WCAG 2.2 + canary** keep the product accessible and safely rolled out; both are mainstream standards now. ([W3C][7], [docs.aws.amazon.com][8])

If you say **“ship v3”**, I’ll regenerate the file with:

* the **Origin & Rationale** page,
* your **10 business rules** and revenue model embedded as gates,
* adversarial consensus as the **central** release blocker,
* OPA policy stubs,
* and a short appendix mapping each of the **5 failed projects → which guardrail prevents a repeat**—all cross-referenced to SSDF/SLSA/OTLP/DORA/WCAG/AI-Act/FOCUS.

Shipped. Here’s your tailored, adversarial-consensus blueprint with budget gates, provenance/signing, OTLP, WCAG, and FOCUS baked in—aligned to your Phase −1/0/1 and your research artifacts.

[Download **enterprise\_blueprint\_2025\_v3.md**](sandbox:/mnt/data/enterprise_blueprint_2025_v3.md)

## What’s new vs v2 (closing the gaps)

* **Origin & motivation up front** (“after five failures → zero-trust validation”).
* **Your Business Context Package is first-class:** 10 non-negotiable rules, 78% target, and the **\$300 target / \$500 ceiling** called out explicitly.
* **Adversarial trinity as the spine:** CrewAI **Planner → Builder → Auditor → Saboteur** with 2-of-3 multi-model consensus + auditor reproduction as a **blocking gate**; sabotage is a hard fail.&#x20;
* **Composer-First with tool pins** surfaced (Gitleaks v8.18.0, TruffleHog v3.63.2, Semgrep 1.50.0) and a **pinned-digest** rule (`image@sha256:...`).&#x20;
* **Policy-as-code stubs (OPA/Rego)** included for: budget ceiling (FOCUS), provenance/signing required (SLSA + Cosign), and OTLP trace smoke. (OPA docs confirm Rego & CI/pipeline use.) ([openpolicyagent.org][1])
* **Standards appendix** with the exact frameworks your blueprint claims to meet: **NIST SSDF (SP 800-218)**, **NIST 800-218A (GenAI profile)**, **NIST AI RMF 1.0**, **ISO/IEC 42001**, **EU AI Act Art. 14**, **SLSA + Cosign**, **OpenTelemetry OTLP**, **DORA Four Keys**, **WCAG 2.2**, **FinOps FOCUS**—each already linked to a concrete control in the doc. ([csrc.nist.gov][2], [nvlpubs.nist.gov][3], [NIST][4], [ISO][5], [artificialintelligenceact.eu][6], [SLSA][7], [Sigstore][8], [OpenTelemetry][9], [dora.dev][10], [W3C][11], [Focus FinOps][12])
* **Progressive delivery thresholds** (canary → ramp → rollback) codified per AWS Well-Architected/whitepapers. ([wa.aws.amazon.com][13], [docs.aws.amazon.com][14])
* **Appendix template** to map your **5 historical failures → preventing guardrails** so the rationale is audit-ready.&#x20;

## Why these controls are the 2025 baseline (receipts)

* **Secure SDLC:** NIST **SSDF** is the reference secure-software framework; NIST also published **SP 800-218A** to profile SSDF for GenAI producers/users. ([csrc.nist.gov][2], [nvlpubs.nist.gov][3])
* **Supply-chain integrity:** **SLSA** defines provenance levels; **Sigstore/Cosign** is the standard mechanism to sign/verify artifacts (including keyless/OIDC). ([SLSA][7], [Sigstore][15])
* **Observability:** **OTLP** is stable for traces/metrics/logs and vendor-neutral—perfect for your smoke-trace gate. ([OpenTelemetry][9])
* **Delivery performance:** DORA’s **Four Keys** remain the evidence-based KPI set for software delivery. ([dora.dev][10])
* **Accessibility:** **WCAG 2.2** is a W3C Recommendation; AA is the expected bar for modern web apps. ([W3C][11])
* **AI governance:** **EU AI Act Art. 14** requires human oversight for high-risk AI; **ISO/IEC 42001** and **NIST AI RMF 1.0** align governance & risk management. ([artificialintelligenceact.eu][6], [ISO][5], [NIST][4])
* **Budget enforcement:** **FinOps FOCUS** is the open billing schema you can wire to CI to block on forecast overages. (1.0 GA; 1.2 extends to SaaS/PaaS.) ([finops.org][16], [Focus FinOps][17])
* **Progressive rollout:** Canary/blue-green with auto-rollback is explicitly recommended by AWS Well-Architected and CodeDeploy docs. ([wa.aws.amazon.com][13], [docs.aws.amazon.com][18])
* **Consensus/adversarial validation:** Research shows **self-consistency**, **tree-of-thoughts**, and **multi-agent debate** improve reasoning/factuality—hence the 2-of-3 gate with an independent auditor in your flow. ([arXiv][19])
* **Policy-as-code:** **OPA/Rego** and Conftest are standard for CI-enforced controls across IaC, pipelines, and app configs. ([openpolicyagent.org][1], [conftest.dev][20])

## Mirrors your research (not a generic template)

* Phase **−1/0/1** structure, **19→G01–G20** guardrail mapping, and your **Composer-First + Docker-First** course-correction are embedded.
* Your **10 rules**, **\$300/\$500** budget gates, **78%** target, and **CrewAI** roles are surfaced in the front-matter and the gates.

---

If you want, I can also auto-generate:

* `docker-compose.guardrails.yml` with **digest-pinned** images,
* a **GitHub Actions** workflow wiring all gates,
* and an `opa/` folder with the Rego policies from the blueprint.

Say the word (“generate the runner”), and I’ll spit out the files ready to drop into your repo.
