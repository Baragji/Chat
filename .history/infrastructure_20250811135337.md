Absolutely, let’s do a quick rewind and lay it out step-by-step in big tech terms, but in a very human way.
So when a big tech company has a new idea they want to build, here’s the usual chain of events:

Idea and Requirements: It starts with someone saying, “Hey, we need to solve this problem.” That’s usually a product manager or a product owner. They define what the problem is and what success looks like.
Tech Lead or Architect Steps In: Then a technical lead or an architect comes in. This is the person who figures out what tools and technologies are needed. They say, “We need this tool to handle security, this tool to handle code quality,” and so on.
Research and Validation: That same tech lead or sometimes a senior developer does a bit of research. They check which versions of tools fit best together so everything runs smoothly. They kind of act like the “validator” who decides, “Okay, these are the tools and versions we’ll use.”
Build a Plan: Once they’ve picked the right tools and confirmed they all play nicely together, they put together a plan. This plan says, “Here’s how we’re going to build it, here are the tools we’ll use, and here’s how we’ll keep it all running smoothly.”
Approval and Go: Finally, once that plan is set, it might go to a manager or the CEO just to get a green light. But the heavy lifting of choosing the tools and versions is usually done by that tech lead or architect.
So in short, you’d have a product manager defining the problem, a tech lead picking and validating the tools, and then a plan that gets approved. That’s the whole flow from idea to action.
