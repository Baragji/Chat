Short version: Claude is right that **dependency management must be first-class**—and I should have shipped that foundation alongside the runner. But his *blanket rejection* of the delivery is not justified: the core controls I provided are exactly what top guidance calls for in 2025. Here’s the evidence.

# What stands (and why)

* **Secure-SDLC baseline (NIST SSDF) + AI addendum.** The blueprint centers on SSDF (SP 800-218) and its 2024 AI profile (SP 800-218A). That’s the U.S. reference model for secure development, explicitly extended for generative-AI producers and AI-using systems. ([nvlpubs.nist.gov][1], [NIST Computer Security Resource Center][2])
* **Supply-chain integrity: SLSA provenance + Sigstore/Cosign signing.** These are the current frameworks/mechanisms for tamper-resistant build→artifact→deploy. SLSA defines the provenance levels; Cosign is the widely used verifier/signing tool. ([SLSA][3], [Sigstore][4])
* **Digest pinning (no `:latest`).** Docker’s own docs recommend **pinning to image digests** to guarantee immutability and supply-chain integrity—precisely what the runner enforces. ([Docker Documentation][5])
* **Observability as a gate (OpenTelemetry/OTLP).** OTLP for traces/metrics/logs is a stable, vendor-neutral spec; making “trace seen” a blocking smoke test is correct. ([OpenTelemetry][6])
* **Delivery performance via DORA “Four Keys.”** This remains the evidence-backed way to run and improve delivery with a tiny team. ([dora.dev][7], [Google Cloud][8])
* **Accessibility baseline.** WCAG 2.2 is a W3C Recommendation; AA is the expected bar. ([W3C][9])
* **Human oversight for AI.** Oversight is a legal requirement for high-risk AI under the EU AI Act (Art. 14)—which the blueprint bakes into the gates. ([artificialintelligenceact.eu][10], [SSRN][11])

# Where Claude’s critique is **correct** (and already in motion)

Your notes emphasize **G07: Emergency Dependency Management FIRST**—automated updates + SCA scanning + a compatibility strategy. That’s a fair gap to call out. &#x20;

Concretely, best practice is:

* **Automated version updates** with Renovate or Dependabot (grouped PRs, schedules, allowlists). ([docs.renovatebot.com][12], [GitHub Docs][13])
* **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)** for app deps (not just containers): OWASP **Dependency-Check** and/or **Snyk Open Source** to catch direct/transitive vulns and license risks. ([owasp.org][14], [jeremylong.github.io][15], [docs.snyk.io][16])
* **Policy-as-code** to enforce hygiene (e.g., “no stale critical CVEs,” “update PRs must pass tests”)—fully aligned with CNCF supply-chain best practices. ([CNCF TAG Security][17], [CNCF][18])

# Why “pins only” is **not** enough (and what I did vs. what’s missing)

* I **pinned images by digest** and generated **SBOM→vuln scans** (Syft→Grype), plus IaC/FS scans (Checkov/Trivy), Scorecard, and policy gates—those are solid supply-chain controls. ([cyclonedx.org][19], [GitHub][20])
* What was **missing** for G07 was the **update *machinery*** (Renovate/Dependabot) and an explicit **compatibility matrix/rollback plan** you asked for. That’s the part Claude flagged, and he’s right to insist it be present.&#x20;

# Bottom line

* **Rejection on principle?** Not warranted—the runner and blueprint align with NIST SSDF (+218A), SLSA+Cosign, OTLP, DORA, WCAG, and EU AI Act oversight. Those are mainstream 2025 expectations, not over-engineering. ([nvlpubs.nist.gov][1], [NIST Computer Security Resource Center][21], [SLSA][22], [Sigstore][4], [OpenTelemetry][6], [dora.dev][7], [W3C][9], [artificialintelligenceact.eu][10])
* **Actionable gap?** Yes: **ship the dependency-management foundation** (Renovate/Dependabot config, SCA for app deps, compatibility matrix + rollback policy) so G07 is enforceable, not aspirational. ([docs.renovatebot.com][23], [GitHub Docs][13], [owasp.org][14], [docs.snyk.io][16])

If you want me to **add Renovate + Dependabot + OWASP Dependency-Check/Snyk wiring** (and a “known-good versions” matrix) to the repo alongside the runner, say “**ship G07 pack**” and I’ll drop the files.
