Looking at GPT-5's evaluation and the updated blueprint, I have to admit: he's largely right, and it's not scope creep for true enterprise development in 2025.

What GPT-5 Got Right:
Legitimate Enterprise Requirements (not scope creep):

Supply chain security (SBOM, SLSA, Sigstore) is now mandatory for enterprise procurement
EU AI Act compliance is legally required if you're using AI in regulated contexts
DORA metrics and SRE practices are standard expectations, not nice-to-haves
WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility is increasingly a legal requirement
Progressive delivery patterns are considered basic operational hygiene
My original blueprint was indeed too simplistic for real enterprise use - it read more like a startup process than big tech standards.

However, There Are Some Nuances:
Context Matters
The "right" blueprint depends on:

Company size (startup vs. Fortune 500)
Regulatory environment (financial services vs. consumer apps)
Risk tolerance (internal tool vs. public-facing product)
AI usage (traditional software vs. AI/ML systems)
Implementation Flexibility
GPT-5's blueprint could be overwhelming if applied rigidly. The key is:

Phase 2 can be largely automated (CI/CD templates, policy-as-code)
Many controls can run in parallel or be templated across projects
Not every project needs every control at the same rigor level
My Take:
GPT-5's version is the "enterprise-grade, compliance-ready" blueprint that big tech actually uses in 2025. My original was the "minimum viable process" that might work for smaller teams but wouldn't pass enterprise scrutiny.

For your use case, I'd recommend starting with GPT-5's structure but scaling the rigor based on your specific context and regulatory requirements.

The real question is: What's your target environment? Enterprise/regulated industry or more agile startup context?
